# What is DBMS?

A database-management system (DBMS) is a collection of interrelated data and a set of programs to access those data.
The collection of data, usually referred to as the database, contains information relevant to an enterprise.
The primary goal of a DBMS is to provide a way to store and retrieve database information that is
both convenient and efficient.

Database systems are designed to manage large bodies of information. Management of data involves both
defining structures for storage of information and providing mechanisms for the manipulation of information.
In addition, the database system must ensure the safety of the information stored, despite system
crashes or attempts at unauthorized access. If data are to be shared among several
users, the system must avoid possible anomalous results.
