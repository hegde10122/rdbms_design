# 1) What is data, database and a DBMS?

Storing data and retrieving information is the key for businesses to run efficiently. The term data can be defined as 
facts about something or someone. 
For example, data can be anything such as name of a person, number or images, video etc. 

When the data is converted to meaningful and useful form then it is called as information. 
A database can be defined as a collection of related data from which users can efficiently retrieve the desired information.
Computer databases have replaced tons of paper,file folders and ledgers as the primary media to store all information.
Thus, the collection of data, usually referred to as the database, contains information relevant to an enterprise or business.

A database-management system (DBMS) is an integrated set of programs used to create,access and maintain a database.

The primary goal of a DBMS is to provide a way to define, store,manipulating and retrieving database information that is
both convenient and efficient.

Database systems are designed to manage large bodies of information. Management of data involves both
defining structures for storage of information and providing mechanisms for the manipulation of information.
In addition, the database system must ensure the safety of the information stored, despite system
crashes or attempts at unauthorized access. If data are to be shared among several
users, the system must avoid possible anomalous results.

Thus the database and the DBMS software are collectively called as Database systems.
